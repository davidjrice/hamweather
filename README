Hamweather
==========

This is a Ruby API to an XML webservice providing weather detail for global locations.
It can handle diverse locations by Zip Code, Canadian Post code or by any international address.

* It requires a Google Maps API key: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
* It requires a Hamweather API key, contact Hamweather to discuss: http://www.hamweather.com/

Installation
------------
> sudo gem install davidjrice-hamweather

Usage
-----
require 'rubygems'
require 'hamweather'

*** Hamweather is a singleton class, it takes the two API keys as such:
Hamweather.google_maps_api_key = " ... "
Hamweather.api_key = " ... "

@location = Hamweather.locate('Belfast')    # Assuming your location is unambiguous:
@forecast = Hamweather.forecast(@location)  # Forecast is returned as a Hamweather::Forecast object

What 'address' to use?
----------------------
Zip Code, Canadian Postcode, International Address - it doesn't really matter.
This API uses the Google Maps API to geolocate any address which doesn't fit either of the former
precisely.
Which means the user could input "Lodnon" and get the right location as it's parsing is intelligent.

Using Hamweather::Location
--------------------------
If the 'address' you enter is ambiguous, the API may return a hash of Location objects which you can
use to choose. Check this by: @location.kind_of?(Hash)
Otherwise @location.zipcode @location.postcode? @location.geocode? will tell you what type of
Location you have.

Using Hamweather::Forecast
--------------------------
Assuming @location has been defined, @forecast = Hamweather.forecast(@location) will return a 
Hamweather::Forecast object. A Forecast object has two available hashes: dailies{} and hourlies{}
which give all available Daily forecasts and Hourly forecasts respectively. Each Daily or Hourly
forecast is a Hash of Hamweather::Forecast::Daily or Hamweather::Forecast::Hourly objects.

The Daily object has a list of it's Hourly Forecasts available to you: 'hours'
Forecast variables available in a Daily forecast are:
  :high_farenheit
  :high_celsius
  :low_farenheit
  :low_celsius
  :day
  :date
  :expected_weather
  :detail
  :probability_of_preciptiation

Forecast variables available in an Hourly forecast are:
  :date
  :time
  :expected_weather
  :temp_celsius
  :temp_farenheit
  :probability_of_precipitation
  :precipitation_millimeters
  :precipitation_inches
  :dew_point_celsius
  :dew_point_farenheit
  :relative_humidity
  :wind_speed_knots
  :wind_speed_mph
  :wind_direction
